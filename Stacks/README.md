# Stacks

This section will cover problems on stack creation, manipulation and conversion.

## Description

A stack is data structure to store data elements. However, unlike array, the elements can be inserted (push) or removed(pop) in a particular order.
The order can be  LIFO (Last in First Out) or FILO (First in Last Out)

Following is the graphical representation of stack.


A stack can be implemented using an array or linkedlist.

## Stack Operations

- push : inserting an element into stack
- pop : returns top element of stack and removes it from the stack
- peek : returns the top element of stack, without removing it
- isEmpty :  checks if stack is empty

## General Complexities

The time complexity for all the above stack operations is <b>O(1)</b> and the space complexity
is <b>O(n)</b> where n is length of the stack
