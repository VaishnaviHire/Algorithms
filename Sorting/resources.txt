Classifying Sorts:
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- internal vs external (internal - sorting occurs in RAM, external - sorting occurs on disk or external memory)
- stability (when two numbers are equal order is preserved - stable, not preserved- unstable)
- recursive vs iterative
-  comparison vs non comparison sort
